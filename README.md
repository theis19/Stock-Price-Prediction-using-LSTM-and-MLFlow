# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM + MLflow Tracking

This project implements a time series forecasting pipeline using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict **BMRI.JK (Bank Mandiri)** stock prices. The pipeline includes feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and complete **MLflow integration** for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility.

## Objectives

- Predict the next-day stock price of BMRI.JK using historical data.
- Compare performance against a naive baseline model.
- Log all key metrics, artifacts, and model versions with MLflow.
- Register the best model automatically based on RMSE.

## Model Architecture

- 2 LSTM layers (50 units each)
- Dropout layers (0.2)
- Final Dense layer with 1 output neuron
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Features Used
   Main Feature:
- **BMRI.JK Closing Price**

   Side Features (Not shown in the result because they worsen the model performance):
   - Volume
   - MACD
   - RSI
   - MA5
   - MA20
   - BBNI, BBCA, BBRI Price Change as a part of 4 Big Banks

## Experiment Tracking with MLflow

Each run tracks:

- Parameters: tickers, window size, model architecture, train/test sizes, etc.
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R², MAE percentage, mean/STD of actual prices.
- Artifacts: 
  - Training curves (loss/RMSE)
  - Prediction vs. actual price plot
  - Residual histogram
  - Model summary
  - Trained `.h5` model + scaler + config
- Auto-registration of best model based on lowest RMSE.

```bash

## 🧪 Baseline Comparison

A naive forecast (predicting next day's price as today’s) was used as a baseline. Results were compared using MAE and RMSE to assess the value of the LSTM model.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **R² Score**
- **MAE Percentage** (relative to mean actual price)

These metrics are logged and plotted after every experiment.
